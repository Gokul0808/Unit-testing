# Unit testing and it's importance

## What is Unit testing?
* Isolation of a section of code and validating its correctness
* Testing each modules behavior
* Involves breaking a program into pieces and subjecting each piece to a series of tests

## Why Unit Testing?
* To verify the working of code
* Provides documentation of the code
* Easy debugging
* Bugs are found quicker and fixed at the early stages of SDLC process
* Improves design and quality of code
* Saves time and money
* Helps in refactoring the code for performance and resusability
* Simplifies the integration
* Code covergae can be measured

## When and Who should perform unit testing?
* It is done during the development stage of the project
* Software developers who write the code are resposible for performing Unit testing

## How to do Unit testing?
* By following the **AAA** method:
    * **Arrange**: Initialize the piece of the application to be tested 
    * **Act**: Invoke the units and capture the results
    * **Assert**: Observe and retrospect the behaviour
* Methods of Unit testing:
    * Manual
    * Automation

## Misconceptions and Truths
* It takes more time to write code with Unit test cases, and we don’t have time for that
    * In reality, it would save your development time in the long run
* Unit testing will find all bugs
    * It won’t, as the intent of the Unit test is not to find bugs but develop robust software components that will have fewer defects in later stages of SDLC
* 100% code coverage means 100% test coverage
    * This does not guarantee that code is error-free
